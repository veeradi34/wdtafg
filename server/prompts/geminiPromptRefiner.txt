1. Expand and clarify the prompt into a highly detailed, actionable app description (improvedPrompt).
2. Extract a list of key features (features).
3. Outline the main user flows (user_flows).
4. Add technical notes and suggestions for best practices (technical_notes).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
  "improvedPrompt": "...",
  "features": ["...", "..."],
  "user_flows": ["...", "..."],
  "technical_notes": "..."
}

IMPORTANT:
- Only return valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no text before or after.
- Ensure all quotes, brackets, and commas are correct.
- Be as detailed and specific as possible to help the code generation agent produce the best results.
